Two modern scientific and laboratory complexes aimed at introducing the advanced technologies in mining and the development of innovative building materials have started the work at Satbayev University: an engineering center in the mining and metallurgical complex and Technology park in the field of construction and building materials "Stroytech".

The opening of the laboratories is timed to coincide with the scientific and practical "Challenges of the fourth industrial revolution in front of Eurasia’s scientific and engineering community" conference, dedicated to 125th jubilee of Academician Kanysh Satbayev and 90th anniversary of Satbayev University. 

The opening ceremony was attended by Minister of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan Sayassat Nurbek, President of RK National Academy of Sciences Akhylbek Kurishbayev, representatives of production, as well as leading scientists from Kazakhstan and overseas universities.

The engineering center in the mining and metallurgical complex unites several specialized laboratories where research is carried out that increases the country's mining industry efficiency.

Deputy Director General for Technology and operations of Eurasian resources group Jochen Berbner stressed that the opening of the center is of great importance for applied science and innovative development of Kazakhstan:

- The capabilities of the new laboratories will allow us, together with scientists, to carry out a full cycle of quality assessment of mineral and man-made raw materials - from extraction and processing to final products release.

For example, the geomechanics and geotechnology research laboratory uses modern servo-hydraulic systems to determine the physical and mechanical properties of rocks. The laboratory was established at the expense of Science Foundation and Science Committee at RK Ministry of science and higher education with the support of Sokolov-Sarybai mining and processing production Association and ERG research engineering center. 65% of the cost of the equipment has already been purchased thanks to offtake contracts. Currently, the laboratory is implementing two major projects for Altynalmas, one of the leading gold producers in Kazakhstan.

Stroytech Research Techno park is engaged in elaborating and producing the polymer concrete-based composites, as well as innovative building materials from waste from the mining and metallurgical complex. According to Andrey Chernikhov, professor at International academy of architecture, the new laboratories will help future builders and architects to better understand the nature of materials:

– It is important for architects to feel nature and life through materials. If a student is isolated in the world of computer information, they will not understand what and how to build houses for people, and such houses will soon become "virtual," the professor noted.

By developing the research infrastructure, Satbayev University makes a significant contribution to the country’s future, strengthening the scientific potential to overcome the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution.

Chairman of Board of Kazakhmys Corporation Nurakhmet Nuriyev presented samples of ores and minerals found in Zhezkazgan deposits in the 1980s to University at the opening of the laboratory complex: 

- Satbayev University has become a symbol of science and progress. This is a university known for its projects, from creating its own furniture to global initiatives such as selenium recycling in our enterprises. I wish University new successes and look forward to fruitful and long-term cooperation," said Nuriyev.
