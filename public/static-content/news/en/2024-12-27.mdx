Satbayev University delegation made a working visit to Kuala Lumpur, visiting The Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and Sunway University. Scientists and engineers of Polytech met with foreign colleagues and studied their experience in engineering and scientific research. The delegation was led by Kanai Rysbekov, director of Mining and Metallurgical Institute, and Azat Seitkhan, director and head of Engineering Laboratory.

The visit took place within the framework of the mega-grant BR21881939-OT-23 "Development of resource-saving energy-generating technologies for the mining and metallurgical complex and creation of an innovative engineering center," therefore, the Kazakh delegation focused its attention primarily on the experience of creating such innovation centers in different countries of the world.

During the visit to Sunway University, the delegation participated in a panel session of the international conference Emerging Materials for Sustainable Energy and Environment, where they held productive talks with leading scientists from the USA, Italy, Saudi Arabia and other countries.

The delegation also examined the engineering centers and research laboratories of the university. To do this, they met with Professors Mohammed Khalid and Numan Archid, who work at Sunway Center for Electrochemical Energy and Sustainable Technology, one of Malaysia's leading centers for the study of two-dimensional nanomaterials and their applications in various fields, from energy to biomedical engineering. The guests studied in detail the organization of Sunway University engineering centers, including their technical equipment, project management and integration of innovations into industry.

Within their visit to Universiti Putra Malaysia, Satbayev University scientists met with leading scientists from Faculty of Engineering, Dr. Azmah Hanim and coordinator of Master of Innovation and Engineering Design degree program, Norhairunnisa Mazlan, who shared their experience in integrating the industrial partners into educational and research projects.

The delegation also visited Faculty of Science and Physics Department, where they met with the university's leading scientist in the materials science field. The parties discussed the research of new materials for energy-efficient technologies, as well as the possibilities of joint publications and research projects.

Throughout the visit, the guests got acquainted with the modern laboratories of Universiti Putra Malaysia, studied their technical equipment and the organization of scientific processes. Of particular interest were projects in the field of nanotechnology, materials science, chemical processes, industrial ecology, metallurgy and sustainable technologies that can be applied in evolving the mining and metallurgical complex of Kazakhstan.
