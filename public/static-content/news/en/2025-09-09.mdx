The mining and metallurgical sphere will be enriched with new factories, equipped with modern technologies. The head of state has tasked the Government to bring the metallurgical industry to a new level.

According to the president, this sphere has become the backbone of the country's economy, but its potential has not been fully realized. There are many opportunities for processing rare metals.

The importance of such elements is growing around the world. They are widely used in space industry, energy sector, and also in the production of batteries for electric vehicles.

In this direction, Kazakh scientists have already achieved concrete results. For example, new innovative centers are being opened in the country, and young scientists are conducting research on the processing and enrichment of rare metals.

According to analysts, these initiatives will contribute to accelerating the implementation of new production processes, as envisaged by the president.
